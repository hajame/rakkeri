# Räkkeri

Räkkeri is a time tracking web application. It let's you estimate and track the time you spend on different project tasks.

## Main features

Räkkeri let's you perform the following workflow:

1. Define your project tasks (e.g. "Write introduction")
2. Sort your project tasks into categories (e.g. "Writing")
3. Define initial time estimates for each task
4. Start time tracking for a task

At the end of your project, you can see how well your original estimates compare against your tracked hours (e.g):

| Category | Task               | Estimate (h) | Actual (h) |
| -------- | ------------------ | ------------ | ---------- |
| Writing  | Write introduction | 5            | 7          |
|          | Write conclusion   | 4            | 2          |
| Editing  | Edit introduction  | 2            | 3          |
